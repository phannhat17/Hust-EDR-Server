# EDR Agent Configuration File
# This file contains all configuration options for the EDR Agent
# You can customize these values according to your environment

# Server Configuration
server_address: "localhost:50051"  # EDR server address (host:port)
use_tls: true                      # Enable TLS encryption for server communication

# Agent Identification
agent_id: ""                       # Agent ID (leave empty for auto-generation)
agent_version: "1.0.0"            # Agent version

# File Paths
log_file: ""                       # Log file path (leave empty for console output)
data_dir: "data"                   # Directory for agent data storage

# Logging Configuration
log_level: "info"                  # Log level: debug, info, warn, error
log_format: "console"              # Log format: console, json

# Timing Configuration (in minutes)
scan_interval: 5                   # IOC scan interval
metrics_interval: 30               # System metrics reporting interval

# Connection Configuration (in seconds)
connection_timeout: 30             # Connection timeout
reconnect_delay: 5                 # Delay between reconnection attempts
max_reconnect_delay: 60            # Maximum reconnection delay
ioc_update_delay: 3                # Delay before requesting IOC updates
shutdown_timeout: 500              # Shutdown timeout (milliseconds)

# System Monitoring Configuration
cpu_sample_duration: 500           # CPU sampling duration (milliseconds)

# Windows-specific Configuration
sysmon_log_path: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs\\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx"
hosts_file_path: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts"
blocked_ip_redirect: "127.0.0.1"   # IP address to redirect blocked domains to

# Configuration Notes:
# - All timing values are validated against minimum and maximum limits
# - The agent will auto-generate an ID if not specified
# - TLS is recommended for production environments
# - Log files will be created automatically if they don't exist
# - Data directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist

# Configuration Validation Limits:
# - scan_interval: 1-1440 minutes (1 minute to 24 hours)
# - metrics_interval: 1-1440 minutes (1 minute to 24 hours)
# - connection_timeout: 5-300 seconds (5 seconds to 5 minutes)
# - reconnect_delay: must be > 0
# - max_reconnect_delay: must be >= reconnect_delay
# - blocked_ip_redirect: must be a valid IP address
